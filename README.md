Hello! My name is Brian Dallaire and I am currently a Senior in Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington.

This is a portfolio that contains all of the coding projects I have done from courses and on my own time,
largely split into the language I've used. These include:

  1. C/C++
  2. SystemVerilog
  3. Java
  4. Python
